        <h4>About me</h4>
        <p>
          I have been a full stack engineer since 2020. Prior to that, I had
          been a software testing engineer for a number of years. I have to
          admit that this has been a very rewarding journey. It took a lot of
          effort but I loved every minute of it. I am proud to say that I have
          used every possible minute to learn and improve my skills in the last
          five years. This website was originally developed in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the second version of a responsive{" "}
          <strong>full stack website</strong>. I first developed it in 2020.
          From creating a favicon image, designing the look and feel,
          architecing the backend and frontend, implementing a sandwich bar for
          cell phone usage, to generating a SSL certificate and deployment, I
          did everything from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Building a website with good performance, security, scalability, and
          maintainability requires far more than following a web development
          tutorial or any framework template. I have run into quite a few sticky
          situations in production that were triggered by misusage of a library,
          a framework, or even the JavaScript language. An easy task eventually
          turned into a very expensive or an impossible task without
          redeveloping the whole feature. How did this happen? Or how to avoid
          such kind of disaster from happening again? I have realized that it
          all comes down to one principle:
          <strong> DONâ€™T IMITATE, UNDERSTAND.</strong> This is a principle that
          was advocated by <strong>Tony Alicea</strong>, my favorite web course
          instructor, and the author of
          <strong>JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts</strong>. There's no
          other engineer like him out there that has impacted me so deeply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working in a fast growing technical world, engineers have to
          constantly learn new skills, almost every day. While learning is a
          very rewarding thing to do, it does take time. How to decide what to
          learn? Once again, try to learn the fundamentals and understand the
          idea of the original author. To give an example: an engineer who truly
          understand how React works would be very careful adding an extra{" "}
          <strong>div</strong> tag because it will affect the performance. Yet
          I've seen numerous usage of the div tags when they could be removed. A
          thriving team needs engineers who truly understand how each tech stack
          works. I always try to be one of those. I believe this effort is what
          makes me a real engineer, not a web framework executor.

          I started by bookmarking these resources and then quickly realized
          that a bookmark feature cannot meet my needs. That's when I started to
          design and develop this website. Whenever I discover something
          valuable, I'd be able to add and categorize it to this website
          directly and also comment on it. Since it's mainly for my personal
          usage, some pages and functions are not visible to you, However, I'm
          sharing with you some of the most valuable resources. If you are also
          a web developer, I hope that you can benefit from my list. Swimming in
          the google ocean isn't really fun, because it takes a lot of time to
          sort out what's worth reading and learning and who is best at
          explaning technologies. I would also appreciate it if you could share
          with me your suggestions about this website or great resources you
          have found out under the
          <Link to="/suggestion"> Your Suggestions</Link> area. I will continue
          to work on it. Here is the{" "}
          <a href="https://github.com/yhygh/haiyan">source code</a>. Looking
          back, I'd like to rewrite this whole website if I had time. :)
          <strong> Thank you!</strong>

          I solved over 500 Leetcode's problems in both JavaScript and Python.
          On the average, I solved each problem in three or four different
          approaches. I love reading other people's solutions. Brilliant people
          from all over the world came up with so many smart ideas that it is
          such a pleasure learning other people's thought process, logic, coding
          styles and tricks.
