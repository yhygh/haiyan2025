This is a full stack website that uses ReactJS in the frontend and NodeJS, Express and MongoDB in the backend. It is still in progress.

I work on this project partly for fun, but also use it as a place to demonstrate some of my full stack development skills.

I'm still actively working on it. Will update the README once I'm done.

Each tech section contains multiple guru links.
