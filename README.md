# Introduction

This is a full stack website that uses ReactJS in the frontend and NodeJS, Express and MongoDB in the backend. It is still in progress.

This website is partly a fun project to work on, but it is also a place to demonstrate some of my full stack development skills.

I'm actively working on it. Will continue update the README whenever I make more progress.

Each tech section contains multiple guru links.
