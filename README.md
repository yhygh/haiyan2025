This is a full stack website that uses ReactJS in the frontend and NodeJS and Express in the backend. MongoDB was the database.

This project is partly for fun, but also as a place to demonstrate my full stack development skills.

It is not complete yet. I'm still actively working on it. Will update the README
once I'm done.

Each tech section contains multiple guru links.
